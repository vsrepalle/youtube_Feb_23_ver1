  "details": "India just joined the robotic future with AI-powered robot dogs patrolling public spaces. These mechanical canines run on advanced deep learning algorithms, detecting explosives and reading license plates from 100 meters away with 99.7% accuracy. Made by a Bengaluru-based AI startup, they're being tested at airports and metro stations. Unlike human officers, their AI never gets tired, never blinks, and processes millions of data points per second. The robots use reinforcement learning to improve their patrol patterns daily. Privacy activists are alarmed, but the government says the AI systems are trained only for crowd management and disaster response. With 360-degree computer vision and two-way neural voice synthesis, these robot dogs represent India's leap into AI-powered law enforcement.",
